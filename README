----------------------------------------------------------------------

vibcorr utilizes perturbative approach (see
X.Chen et al. DOI: 10.1039/c0cp01443e;
V.Barone et al. DOI: 10.1080/00268976.2013.796413)
to calculate ZPVC for molecular properties (at the moment harmonic
contribution to ZPVC to hyperfine coupling constants). Essentially vibcorr
runs a series of quantum chemical calculations using ORCA program package
(https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/index.php) and performs numerical
differentiation of the property of interest.

SETUP

  In vibcorr.ini file:
  1. Set path to your ORCA distribution in orcapath variable in [SYSTEM]
  block.
  2. Set number of cores to be used in calculations in pal variable in
  [SYSTEM] block.
  3. Set differentiation step size (defined as max cartesian displacement
  along vibrational mode) in [OPTIONS] block (this might be a bit tricky as
  arbitrary property dependence on displacement along a vibrational mode is
  not guaranteed to deviate significantly from linear dependence and a too
  small step can lead to a randomly large contribution)
  4. Set nuclei of interest in prop_block variable in [CALCULATION] block.
  5. Set charge and multiplicity in method variable in [CALCULATION] block.
  Note, here were are using B3LYP/N07D method (V.Barone et al. DOI:
  10.1021/ct800034c) for geometry optimization and HFC constants
  calculation. Generally method can be changed though {} fields in method
  variable should be kept in their places.

USAGE

  ./vibcorr mygeometry.xyz

  vibcorr will read geometry from xyz file (in angstrom), perform geometry
  optimization, frequency calculation and HFC constants at the defined in
  vibcorr.ini level of theory and write results to mygeometry_vibcorr.log

MODIFICATION

  Any other property harmonic ZPVC can be calculated using vibcorr:
  1. Add a new function to vibcorr_util.py, which accepts filename (without
  extension), parses any file outputted by ORCA and returns NumPy array
  with property of interest.
  2. Add the function name to prop_funcs dictionary in vibcorr_util.py file.
  3. Write the function name to prop_func variable in vibcorr.ini file.
  4. Write ORCA input block to prop_block variable in [CALCULATION] block
  in in vibcorr.ini file.
  5. Adjust step size.
